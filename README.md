# Streetscape

Streetscape is an interactive web-based tool designed for urban planners, engineers, and designers to visualize and edit street layouts. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, modifying, and analyzing various street elements such as lane design, traffic control devices, traffic calming, and more.

  - **Color**: White, Yellow, Red.
  - **Width**: Multiple options (e.g., 6", 2').
  - **Style**: Solid, Long Dashed, Short Dashed.
- Generate offset lines with configurable distance and repetition.
- Calculate the radius of curved lane lines.

### 3. **Pavement Polygons**
- Draw and edit pavement areas with customizable properties:
  - **Stroke Color**: Define the border color.
  - **Fill Color**: Choose from a palette or custom colors.
  - **Opacity**: Adjust transparency for better visualization.
- Automatically calculate and display the area in square feet and square yards.

### 4. **Traffic Control Markers**
- Add markers for traffic control elements such as:
  - Bike lanes, sharrows, parking, and speed tables.
  - MUTCD-compliant signs (e.g., stop signs, no turn on red).
- Rotate markers using an intuitive angle selector.

### 5. **Text Labels**

- Load existing `.geojson` files to restore or modify designs.

### 8. **Project Settings**
- Set and save the default map view (center and zoom level).
- Manage base layers and overlay layers.
- Clear all map elements with a single click.

### 9. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `L`: Start drawing a new lane line.
